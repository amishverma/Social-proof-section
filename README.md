## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to pratice more on my HTML5 and CSS3 skills to get better in desgning and developing new layouts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.testimonial + .testimonial {
  margin-left: 2rem;
}
```

I got to know how more efficiently we could use the css combinators to style our page. I have used the adjacent sibling selector to add margins for correct layout.

### Continued development

I would love to work more on my css skills to practice to how to make good responsive designs in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) - This helped me to understand more about css combinators and clear some of my previous misconceptions about the css selectors reason.
